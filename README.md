# Kickstarter_Analysis

Given the provided data, three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns are:
In comparing categories, we can see that theater has the most campaigns, and we can see that Kickstarter can be a successful means for achieving funding.
When comparing the highest number of successful campaigns, we can see that plays had both the highest number of successful and failed campaigns. Thus we can see that plays are the most popular investment within all campaigns.
We can also see an apex of successful campaigns in May leading into a decline, therefore indicating that deeper analysis of behavior in late spring would be beneficial when planning a campaign.

Some limitations of this dataset are that we do not have information on the backgrounds and connections of contributors, we do not have any correlating data related to mitigating factors related to the failure of campaigns, and while it is helpful to see the statistics of these campaigns we do not know the level of experience at which these campaigns began.

Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create would be the rate of successful submissions for each campaign, the duration of time for each submission including success/failure rate, and a total trend for successful campaigns over time. These would allow for more analysis of trends within successful campaigns, although we could also generate data for failed, canceled, and live campaigns as well.
